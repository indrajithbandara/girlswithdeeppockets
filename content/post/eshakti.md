Wow, our first submission from the audience and it's great. R posted about this nifty looking online retailer called eShakti.

R had this to say:

>These pockets are huge! Not every single item on the site has pockets, but most of the dresses and skirts have very large pockets. Pockets are large enough to fit an iPhone and a small wallet or other items and on fuller skirted designs, you can't ever tell there's anything in your pockets. Great for work, special occasions or fun!

eShakti ship to America, Canada, Australia, and Singapore (no UK alas) and specialise in customised outfits.

You pick one of their items and adjust key attributes. Given how many pictures have ladies with hands fully in pockets, I really wish they shipped to the UK.

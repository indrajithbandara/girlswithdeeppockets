From our Twitter feed yesterday we had a great suggestion - [SCOTTeVEST](http://www.scottevest.com/).

SCOTTeVEST literally sprang out of a desire for more (and smarter) pockets. Fed up with having to offload a purse on to her husband and fed up with having to carry her purse, Laura and Scott started SCOTTeVEST.

We love the solidarity and mission for this company! Their stuff is useful and even their very classy cardigans have pockets. They ship internationally too. w00t

Thanks for the tip Aaron.

Welcome to **Girls with Deep Pockets**!

I'm Steph and I've been continuously disappointed by the lack of pockets in my clothes for years. They're either missing, fake, or hopelessly inadequate for fitting anything reasonable like a phone in them.

I don't know whether it's the fashion industry's focus on trying to make us look awesome, and sacrificing convenience on the way, or whether it's actually a conspiracy to force us into the purchase of handbags, and adding dramatically to their bottom line.

Irrespective of the cause, I want to combat this! I want to celebrate the awesome people out there giving pockets to the masses. I want to know where I can buy these nifty bits of apparel. *I want to put my phone in a frickin' pocket and not worry about it falling out.*

So please join me in my quest! 

If you can recommend a clothing line, a website, or simply want to show off a purchase, here is the place to do it. Currently, the ways of helping involve [filling out this quick form]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}) or if you're feeling technical, you can [submit your own post]({{< ref "post/submit.md" >}}).

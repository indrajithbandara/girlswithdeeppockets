Found in the comments section of the article [Women's clothes are still utterly impractical - where are my pockets?](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/womens-clothes-feminism-levis-pockets-gender-high-heels-pwc) is a recommendation from one Anne Wareham.

Ann had this to say:

>[Gudren] deserves credit for making comfortable, interesting clothing for women. With pockets. Xxx

Gudrun is a female designer with an ethical bent who has been in fashion for 40 years now. Even some of her earliest sketches have fantasticly big pockets!

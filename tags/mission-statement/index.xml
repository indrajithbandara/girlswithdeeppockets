      <description>Welcome to Girls with Deep Pockets!
I&amp;rsquo;m Steph and I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuously disappointed by the lack of pockets in my clothes for years. They&amp;rsquo;re either missing, fake, or hopelessly inadequate for fitting anything reasonable like a phone in them.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether it&amp;rsquo;s the fashion industry&amp;rsquo;s focus on trying to make us look awesome, and sacrificing convenience on the way, or whether it&amp;rsquo;s actually a conspiracy to force us into the purchase of handbags, and adding dramatically to their bottom line.</description>
